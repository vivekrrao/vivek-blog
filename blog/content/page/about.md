I am a father to 2 beautiful boys, husband, software engineer and a people manager in technology. I love tinkering with software and problem solving through automation. I run a team that is responsible for resiliency, recovery and performance on the cloud. Over the last couple of years, I have taken a keen interest in AWS and have experienced first hand its power and simplicity. I am an *AWS Certified Solutions Architect* and it is my hope that in 2017 I will continue to dig deeper and learn the next big phase of cloud revolution - serverless computing.

My professional profile is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekr1 "LinkedIn") and my Twitter handle is [here](https://www.twitter.com/_vrao_ "@_vrao_").
