      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a father to 2 beautiful boys, husband, software engineer and a people manager in technology. I love tinkering with software and problem solving through automation. I run a team that is responsible for resiliency, recovery and performance on the cloud. Over the last couple of years, I have taken a keen interest in AWS and have experienced first hand its power and simplicity. I am an &lt;em&gt;AWS Certified Solutions Architect&lt;/em&gt; and it is my hope that in 2017 I will continue to dig deeper and learn the next big phase of cloud revolution - serverless computing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My professional profile is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/vivekr1&#34; title=&#34;LinkedIn&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; and my Twitter handle is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/_vrao_&#34; title=&#34;@_vrao_&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
